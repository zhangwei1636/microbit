    WARNING! THIS IS ALPHA CODE.

    警告！这是字母代码。

    We reserve the right to change this API as development continues.

    随着开发的继续，我们保留更改此API的权利。

    The quality of the speech is not great, merely "good enough". Given the
    constraints of the device you may encounter memory errors and / or
    unexpected extra sounds during playback. It's early days and we're
    improving the code for the speech synthesiser all the time. Bug reports
    and pull requests are most welcome.

    演讲的质量不是很好，只是“足够好”。 鉴于设备的限制，您可能会在播放过程中遇到内存错误和/或意外的额外声音。 这是早期的事情，我们一直在改进语音合成器的代码。 错误报告和需求是最受欢迎的。

Computers and robots that talk feel more "human".

电脑和机器人的讲话感觉更“人性化”。

So often we learn about what a computer is up to through a graphical user
interface (GUI). In the case of a BBC micro:bit the GUI is a 5x5 LED matrix,
which leaves a lot to be desired.

因此，我们经常通过图形用户界面（GUI）了解计算机的功能。对于bbc micro:bit，图形用户界面是一个5x5的LED矩阵，这就留下了一些要求。

Getting the micro:bit talk to you is one way to express information in a fun,
efficient and useful way. To this end, we have integrated a simple speech
synthesiser based upon a reverse-engineered version of a synthesiser from the
early 1980s. It sounds very cute, in an "all humans must die" sort of a way.

与micro:bit交谈是一种有趣、高效和有用的表达信息的方式。为此，我们集成了一个基于20世纪80年代早期的逆向工程合成器的简单语音合成器。 这听起来非常可爱，在“所有人类必须死亡”的某种方式。

With this in mind, we're going to use the speech synthesiser to create...

考虑到这一点，我们将使用语音合成器来创建…

It's a little known fact that DALEKs enjoy poetry ~ especially limericks.
They go wild for anapestic meter with a strict AABBA form. Who'd have thought?

这是一个鲜为人知的事实，DALEKs喜欢诗歌
